#  Uber Rides Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project is my **first full data analysis project**. Since it is an initial attempt, the work may contain mistakes or incomplete use of the data. I am still learning and practicing to improve my analytical skills, so any feedback is highly appreciated.  

The dataset comes from an **Uber-like ride-hailing application**, and includes details such as:  
- Ride dates and times  
- Vehicle types  
- Trip durations  
- Customer and driver ratings  
- Ride status (completed, cancelled, or incomplete)  
- Reasons for cancellations  
- Payment methods  

The goal of this project is to **analyze patterns in rides, cancellations, and customer/driver behavior**, while practicing data analysis and visualization skills.
